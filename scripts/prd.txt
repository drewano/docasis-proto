# RAG INTELLIGENT AGENT - PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) intelligent agent that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information from a document database. The agent will integrate Langchain, Qdrant cloud vector database, Docling document transformation, and Gemini LLM to deliver an intelligent document search and question answering system with a streamlined UI built in Streamlit.

### 1.2 Project Objectives
- Create a system that allows users to upload, process, and index documents using Docling and Qdrant
- Develop a RAG pipeline using Langchain that enhances Gemini LLM responses with relevant document context
- Build an intuitive Streamlit interface for document management and interaction with the RAG system
- Implement a document relevance dashboard to evaluate response quality
- Provide a simple mechanism to delete all documents from the database when needed

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Knowledge workers who need quick access to information from large document collections
- Researchers who want to query their research papers and data
- Business professionals looking for insights from company documentation
- Anyone who needs to interact with and extract information from their personal document library

## 2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1 Core Technologies
- **Language/Framework**: Python 3.10+
- **RAG Framework**: LangChain for pipeline construction and orchestration
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant Cloud for vector storage and similarity search

- **Embeddings**: Google text-embedding-004 for vector embeddings
- **UI Framework**: Streamlit for user interface
- **Deployment**: Local deployment with cloud services integration

### 2.2 System Architecture
The system will follow a modular architecture with the following components:
1. **Document Processing Module**: Uses Docling to parse, transform, and chunk documents
2. **Embedding Module**: Processes document chunks using text-embedding-004
3. **Vector Storage Module**: Manages the interaction with Qdrant Cloud
4. **RAG Pipeline Module**: Orchestrates the retrieval and generation process using LangChain
5. **UI Module**: Provides the Streamlit interface for user interaction
6. **Relevance Dashboard Module**: Displays document relevance metrics for generated responses

### 2.3 System Integrations
- Integration with Qdrant Cloud API for vector database operations
- Integration with Google AI API for Gemini LLM and embeddings
- Integration with Docling API for document transformation

## 3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Document Management
- **Document Upload**: Users can upload multiple documents through the left panel of the UI
- **Document Processing**: System automatically processes documents using Docling
- **Document Indexing**: Processed documents are vectorized and stored in Qdrant
- **Document Deletion**: A button allows users to delete all documents from the database

### 3.2 Query Processing
- **Natural Language Queries**: System accepts natural language questions about uploaded documents
- **RAG Processing**: Queries are processed through the RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant context
- **Response Generation**: Gemini LLM generates comprehensive responses based on retrieved context
- **Context Display**: The system shows which document chunks were used to generate the response

### 3.3 Relevance Dashboard
- **Document Relevance Metrics**: Dashboard displays which documents were used and their relevance scores
- **Source Citation**: Responses include citations to source documents
- **Confidence Scoring**: System provides confidence scores for responses
- **Relevance Visualization**: Visual representation of document relevance in the right panel

## 4. USER INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1 Layout and Design
- **Left Panel**: Document upload section and document management controls
- **Center Panel**: Query input and response display
- **Right Panel**: Relevance dashboard showing document citations and scores
- **Clean, Intuitive Design**: Minimalist interface with clear labels and instructions

### 4.2 Document Upload Interface
- Upload area for dragging and dropping files
- Progress indicators for document processing
- Document list showing successfully indexed documents
- Clear button to delete all documents

### 4.3 Query Interface
- Text input field for entering natural language questions
- Submit button to process queries
- Response display area with formatted text
- History of previous queries and responses (optional)

### 4.4 Relevance Dashboard
- Visual representation of document relevance
- Document citation list with relevance scores
- Clickable document references to view source content
- Confidence indicator for overall response quality

## 5. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 Response Time
- Document processing time: Less than 60 seconds for typical documents (<100 pages)
- Query response time: Less than 10 seconds for typical queries
- UI responsiveness: Real-time feedback during all operations

### 5.2 Scalability
- Support for document collections up to 1,000 documents
- Support for document sizes up to 100MB per document
- Efficient handling of concurrent user requests (for future multi-user expansion)

### 5.3 Accuracy and Quality
- High relevance of retrieved document chunks
- High-quality responses that accurately incorporate document information
- Proper citation of sources in responses
- Clear indication when information is not found in the documents

## 6. SECURITY AND PRIVACY

### 6.1 Data Protection
- Document data is processed locally when possible
- Secure transmission of data to cloud services using encryption
- No permanent storage of documents or queries except in Qdrant database
- User control over document deletion

### 6.2 Authentication
- Initial version will not require authentication
- Future versions may include API key management for service integrations

## 7. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### 7.1 Phase 1: Core Functionality
- Set up basic Streamlit application structure
- Implement document upload and Docling integration
- Create Qdrant cloud integration for vector storage
- Develop basic RAG pipeline with Langchain

### 7.2 Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Integrate Gemini LLM and text-embedding-004
- Implement the relevance dashboard
- Add document deletion functionality
- Improve response formatting and presentation

### 7.3 Phase 3: Polish and Optimization
- Optimize performance for larger document collections
